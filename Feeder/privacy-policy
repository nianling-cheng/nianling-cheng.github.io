27.        GENERAL

 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Feeder and You concerning Your use of the Website and Services. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Feeder or by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by Feeder and by the posting by Feeder of such amended version.  A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of Feeder. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. You and Feeder are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Except for the Feeder Parties and the Indemnified Parties as and to the extent set forth in Sections 7, 13, 20(a), 22, and  24(e), and in this paragraph, and Feeder’s licensors and suppliers as to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement or infringement of proprietary or other third-party rights by You would cause irreparable injury to Feeder and Feeder’s licensors and suppliers, and would therefore entitle Feeder or Feeder’s licensors or suppliers, as the case may be, to injunctive relief. The headings in this Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and shall not limit, enlarge, or affect any of the covenants, terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement.
